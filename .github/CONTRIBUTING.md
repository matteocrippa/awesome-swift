To be added to the list, software should meet the following criteria:

If an item on the list no longer meets the above criteria, open an issue to have it be removed.

When adding new items, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the existing format in the JSON file

		"category": "command-line",
		"description": "Compose beautiful command line interfaces in Swift.",

		"tags": ["linux"]
}
```

- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome (open an issue).
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The pull request should include a link to the package and why it should be included.

Thank you for your suggestions!
